This is my solution to wanting to read a musical chart whilst playing along with a metronome.

You'll find:
1)Javascript to handle the metronome (no sound as a personal preference).
2)css to format the display to see everything with having to adjust the screen.
3)PNG picture file for the chart.

Hopefully this could help you in your coding or muscial journey :)
